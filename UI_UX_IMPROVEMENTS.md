# UI/UX Improvements for Reports Page

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Zoom Problems on Laptops
**Problem**: Cards were zooming inappropriately on laptop screens, causing poor UX
**Solution**: 
- Removed problematic `zoom` and `transform: scale()` CSS properties
- Implemented responsive grid system using CSS Grid
- Added proper max-width constraints for different viewport sizes

### 2. Inconsistent Button Layout
**Problem**: Buttons in cards had different alignments and sizes
**Solution**:
- Unified button structure across all report cards
- Created consistent `.btn-group` layout system
- Standardized button heights (44px) and spacing
- Implemented flex-based alignment for perfect button positioning

### 3. Card Height Variations
**Problem**: Cards had different heights causing misaligned layout
**Solution**:
- Set fixed card height (320px on mobile, 350px on desktop, 380px on large screens)
- Used flexbox for internal card layout to ensure content distribution
- Added proper spacing between card sections

### 4. Non-responsive Design
**Problem**: Layout didn't adapt well to different screen sizes
**Solution**:
- Implemented mobile-first responsive design
- Created breakpoint-specific optimizations:
  - Mobile (< 768px): Single column, compact spacing
  - Tablet (768px - 1023px): Two columns, balanced spacing  
  - Desktop (1024px+): Three columns, generous spacing
  - Large Desktop (1400px+): Enhanced typography and spacing
